                            of business. India is a nation of 1.3 billion people and it is this population that grants
                            the digital marketing its biggest strength. With the mobile phone having become a daily
                            necessity, and Indians logging on to YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and what not,

                            products and create a market everywhere. According to an IAMAI survey, India has crossed the
                            mark of 500 million internet users about 2 years back. Every day, the number of internet
                            users is going upwards. This population is aware of the online market and the e-commerce
                            companies are cashing in on it very well. It is time now for the traditional businesses to
                            ride this wave and create for themselves a fascinating business opportunity. It is easy to
                            target a specific group of audience, whether homemakers, college-students, senior citizens

                        <h3>Online Reputation Management</h3>
                        <p>Someone once said, “Your reputation walks 2 feet ahead of you.” Your online reputation is no
                            different. In fact, whether it is a company, service, product, individual or any other
                            element of business, online reputation can make or break your brand name. And though it is
                            very convenient these days to build your online reputation, to sustain it over a period of
                            time is not easy. Therefore, the modern business strategy says that you need an Online
                            Reputation Manager who takes care of how you or your product/service looks to the world, at
                            least digitally. The online reputation is built with the help of public reactions to your
                            product or service online, your company’s interactions with other internet users and your
                            company’s or brand’s online activity. Thus, Online Reputation Management (ORM) is a critical
                            part of your business strategy. It is highly important to maintain a positive brand identity
                            online and as trends suggest, ORM is instrumental in growing your business. You need to
                            devote sufficient time and energy towards monitoring your brand online. An online reputation
                            manager will help you decide what your online reputation should be and then he will also
                            help you assess your current online reputation, followed by suggesting changes to it. That
                            is where Savin Communications comes in. All you have to do is tell us your requirement, and
                            we will take care of everything, minus the headache, of course! Remember, people listen to
                            opinions about strangers and having a good business reputation is imperative for your
                            company or your personality.</p>
                        <h3>Crisis Management</h3>
                        <p>Today’s businesses and business leaders should know a thing or two about crisis management,
                            because a crisis can harm your business or product or service irreparably. Be it a natural
                            disaster, a lawsuit or an internal issue like drowning morale of your workforce, crisis
                            management is a must to know and practice. However, this concept is not applicable only to
                            businesses, but also to individuals active in any sphere of life. In fact, anyone with a
